# Drum Kit Site

Welcome to the Drum Kit site! This interactive project showcases my skills in JavaScript, CSS, and HTML to create a fun and engaging virtual drum kit.

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: The site is designed to be responsive, ensuring a seamless experience across different devices and screen sizes.
- **Dynamic Animations**: Engaging animations enhance the user experience, providing visual feedback when a drum piece is activated.

## Technologies Used

- **CSS**: Styles the site, ensuring an attractive and user-friendly interface.
- **JavaScript**: Adds interactivity, enabling the drum pieces to play sounds and respond to user actions.

## How It Works

- **Keyboard Interaction**: Pressing specific keys on the keyboard triggers the corresponding drum piece to play its sound.
- **Mouse Interaction**: Clicking on a drum piece image also plays the respective sound.
- **Sound Effects**: Each drum piece has a unique sound, making the experience feel like playing a real drum kit.
